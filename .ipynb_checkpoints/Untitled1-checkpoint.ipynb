       " \"Usually after each session I get a headache also. I can't tell if i'm becoming worse, because I did EMDR on my bad drug experiences and feel great now. The rest of what i'm dealing with is early childhood trauma, which was prolonged so i'm thinking EMDR is just bringing out these feelings and making my body become very unhappy since im reprogramming it to not constantly be hyper aware and anxious.

When I was molested, they came to my rescue and constantly stood up for me when nobody else believed me. Sometimes they're the most amazing parents I can ask for, and other times I'm afraid of them. My mother isn't that bad, but my father is the worst.\",\n",
